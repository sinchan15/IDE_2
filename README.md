================================================================================
The first java file "HelpFrame.java" contains the Help option of my text editor 
incase the user needs to delete it.
"myframe.java" contains the main functionality of the text editor and 
"textTransfer" is just an intermediary 'clipboard'
type file which helps in copying, pasting and cutting the data and storing 
them in the clipbord.
